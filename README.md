# Project-03
Third Project of Video Games Design HND course at West Herts College 
## Project Outline ##
Design a system that will allow the player to enter up to 3 random letters. The system will return the best, largest, valid English word that can be made up if the 3 letters (blanks are no allowed). For example: TCA should return CAT, OZR should return OR, ZZA should return A.
## Functional Specifications ##
* The program will need to have a dictionary document implemented into it
*	The program will need to be able to store the userâ€™s input of 3 random letters
*	The program must ensure that the input is 3 letters in length
*	The program will need to be able to split the string of the input into separate letters
*	These letters will then have to be compared to the dictionary to see what words can be made
*	The program will then need to determine which word to pick, by finding the longest word it can create
*	If the program cannot make a 3 letter word the program will need to either create a 2 or 1 letter word depending on what can be made
*	The program should then be able to create and display that word to the user
